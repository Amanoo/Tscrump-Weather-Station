Arduino should send the number of bucket tips to the server, which multiplies it with the amount of millimeters of rain per bucket tip to get a total amount of mm of rain. This allows for changing or adjustment of values on the serverside, without having to reprogram the weather station's microcontroller. This can be useful if the precision of the rain meter is found to be off and needs to be adjusted, or if the rain meter has been recalibrated.
